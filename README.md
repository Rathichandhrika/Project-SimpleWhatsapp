# Project-SimpleWhatsapp
This project is a basic simulation of a messaging app built using Java, mimicking the interaction between two users exchanging messages. It runs in the console, allowing users to input their details and send messages back and forth.

🚀 Features

• Register two users by entering their names and phone numbers
• Simulate message sending between User 1 and User 2
• View complete chat history with sender/receiver info and content
• Simple interactive menu with user choices

🧠 How It Works

• The app defines two classes:
• User: stores name and phone number of each participant
• Message: stores sender, receiver, and message content
• All messages are saved in an ArrayList<Message>
• Users can type messages, switch between sender/receiver, and view chat logs until they choose to exit

🖥️ Sample Interaction

Enter the Name of User 1 : Rithika
Enter the Phone Number of User 1 : 1234567890
Enter the Name of User 2 : Ragul
Enter the Phone Number of User 2 : 9876543210
